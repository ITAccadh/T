    <h3>Our History</h3>
    <p>M's Pizzas was founded in 1995 by Maria Santos, a first-generation immigrant with a passion for Italian cooking. Coming from a family of chefs, Maria had always dreamed of opening her own pizza restaurant. After years of perfecting her recipes and learning the art of pizza making, she opened the doors to the very first M’s Pizzas location in Food City.</p>
    <p>What started as a small family-owned pizzeria quickly became a local favorite. Maria’s dedication to quality and her personal touch in every pizza made M's Pizzas stand out. Over the years, we’ve expanded to multiple locations, but our commitment to fresh ingredients, handcrafted pizzas, and exceptional service has remained unchanged.</p>
    <p>Today, M's Pizzas is more than just a pizzeria – it’s a community hub. We pride ourselves on creating a welcoming atmosphere where friends and families can come together to enjoy a delicious meal. Our menu has grown over the years, but the essence of what we offer has stayed the same – pizza made with love and served with a smile.</p>
